# BPSK_QPSK_OFDM-Matlab-Codes

Here are the list of program which I have made for Communication Lab assignments.
1) I have made Matlab and C program for BPSK with Sinc Pulse shaping with and without Channel at noisy environment.
2) I have made Matlab program for QPSK with Sinc Pulse shaping with and without Channel at noisy environment.  
3) I have made Matlab program for BPSK with Rayleigh Pulse shaping Channel at noisy environment.  
4) I have made Matlab program for BPSK with Sinc Pulse shaping at noisy environment with Sinc pulse is sampled at different time instances.
5) I have made Matlab program for BPSK and QPSK BER comparision with Sinc Pulse shaping without Channel at noisy environment.
6) I have made Matlab and C program for OFDM-BPSK BER at noisy environment.
7) I have made C program for OFDM-BPSK BER at noisy environment with floating and fixed point which is useful for DSP.
8) I have made Matlab program for Cell Search with Cyclic Prefix which is highly useful for 4G-5G application perspective.
